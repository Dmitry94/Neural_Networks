# CS-231 practice repository

There are solutions of [CS-231](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course.

There are two types of solutions for this course:
1. *Old solutions.* They were done at 2016, when there were no assignments.
There were implemented the following models:

    * Nearest neighbor model
    * SVM model
    * Softmax model
    * Neural Net, simple version.

    All code is available [here](https://github.com/Dmitry94/cs231-practice/tree/master/hand-implemented-models).

2. *Assigments solutions.* These solutions were done at 2019. Solutions are
connected to corresponding cs-231 assignments. They can be found at folders with
corresponding names.
